An interactive two-player board game for football fans.

As part of the first project for WDI at General Assembly, this game was built entirely with HTML/CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Bootstrap. A special thanks to <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">Sweet Alert</a> for providing all the beautiful alert boxes.

The board game was inspired by being fans of the Ravens and Seahawks. Knowing that the Ravens don't stand a chance in making a playoffs, I have created this game as an alternative reality to make a girl's dream come true. Not really. I was more inspired to make a board game that's a little different out there.

<b>Instructions</b>

The football is the dice of this board game. Click to start rolling. The Seahawks is blue and the Ravens is purple.

On each line you will see either a football or a whistle. The football represents a bonus! If you roll over those squares, it will instruct you to move forward. On the other hand, if you hit a whistle, you might be instructed to move backwards due to a penalty called upon your time.

This game is solely a small project I did for the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

Have fun and go hawks!
